# System Preferences

First thing you need to do, on any OS actually, is update the system! For that: Apple menu () > About This Mac > Software Update.

Also upgrade your OS in case you want to work on the latest OS. Sierra is a free upgrade so please check that.

If this is a new computer, there are a couple tweaks you would like to make to the System Preferences. Feel free to follow these, or to ignore them, depending on your personal preferences.

## Users & Groups

- Login Options -> Change fast switching user menu to Icon
- Set up Password, Apple ID, Picture, etc.
